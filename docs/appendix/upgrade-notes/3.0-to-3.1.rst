PHP Version
-----------

PHP 7.0 has reached end of life in January 2019. To ensure that Elgg sites are secure, we now require PHP 7.1 for new installations.

If upgrading from a previous Elgg installation make sure you have the correct PHP version installed.


Plugin screenshots
------------------

Screenshots added to plugins are no longer supported and will no longer be shown in the plugin details.

Loading external files
----------------------

The usage of ``elgg_register_js``, ``elgg_unregister_js`` and ``elgg_load_js`` is discouraged.
Make sure your javascript is an AMD module and use ``elgg_require_js`` to include it.

The usage of ``elgg_register_css``, ``elgg_unregister_css`` and ``elgg_load_css`` is discouraged.
You can register and include css with the new ``elgg_require_css`` function.

Setting the page owner via the ``elgg_get_page_owner_guid`` function parameter is deprecated. Use ``elgg_set_page_owner_guid``.
